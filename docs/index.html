<h3>What is the Leadership Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Engineering Leadership Radar is a list of trends, practices, and technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Trends, practices, or technologies categorized as "Adopt" are those that are highly recommended for immediate implementation. They have been proven to provide significant value and benefits, and there is strong evidence of their effectiveness in improving engineering leadership, team performance, or organizational outcomes. Engineering leaders are encouraged to prioritize resources and efforts towards adopting these trends or practices, leveraging them to drive positive change within their teams and organizations.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Trends or practices categorized as "Trial" are those that show promise and potential benefits but may still require further validation or experimentation in a real-world context. Engineering leaders are encouraged to conduct small-scale trials or pilots to assess the feasibility, suitability, and impact of these trends or practices within their specific context. This may involve allocating resources for experimentation, gathering feedback from teams, and monitoring outcomes to determine whether to proceed with broader adoption.</li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Trends, practices, or technologies categorized as "Assess" are those that are worth monitoring and evaluating but may not yet be mature or well-understood enough to justify immediate adoption or trial. Engineering leaders are encouraged to stay informed about these trends or practices, keeping an eye on developments, industry adoption rates, and evolving best practices. They may choose to conduct research, gather feedback from industry peers, or attend relevant conferences or workshops to deepen their understanding and assess the potential impact on their teams or organizations.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Trends, practices, or technologies categorized as "Hold" are those that are either outdated, not recommended, or not suitable for the current context or goals of the organization. Engineering leaders are advised to avoid investing significant resources or effort into these trends or practices and instead focus on alternatives that offer greater potential for value and impact. However, it's essential to periodically review trends in this category, as circumstances may change, and what is currently on hold may become relevant or valuable in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The Engineering Leadership Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering Leaders to pick the right tools for their job; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience for the different dimensions of the job, to reflect on decisions and continuously evolve your leadership abilities. Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, the Engineering Leadership Radar sets out the changes in frameworks, practices and technologies that are interesting in software leadership &mdash; changes that we think engineering leaders should pay attention to and use in their day to day business.
</p>

<!-- <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

<p>
The Engineering Leadership Radar is maintained by a group of <em>Engineering Leaders</em> &mdash; from around the world who facilitate and drive the discussions about the frameworks, practices and technologies. Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on. The Engineering Leadership Radar is open for contribution from all Engineering Leaders and depends on their active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the frameworks, practices and technologies.<br/>
